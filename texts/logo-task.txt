This logo is also something special. You may noticed that I selected your logo used in Future Balls as a placeholder.

The logo shares the palette with the copper colorcycle effect.

You once created several colourgradients within the 256 colours.
For the logo these 256 colours will be divided into 16 colourbanks.
Each bank has 16 colours. The first colour (COLOR00) of each colourbank is always transparent and can't be used.
You select one of these colourbanks for the logo.

The dimension of the logo should be 32x256 pixel with 16 colours.


The vertical scrolltext works nearly with the same logic. It has a transparent background colour (COLOR00) and the visible COLOR01 for the text characters.
These two colours are part of each colourbank. You can choose one of the 16 colourbanks also for the scrolltext.

I decided to use colourbank 14 (orange) for the logo and colourbank 9 (cyan) for the scrolltext. You may have a different choice, that's totally okay.

The scrolltext characters should have the size of 16x15 pixel with 2 colours.
The order of the characters should be A-Z 0-9 . ? ! - ' ( ) : \ / rhombus star space
